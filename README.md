# Efficient File System Management and Energy Optimization

## Overview

This project implements a distributed file system management system with a focus on optimizing storage, I/O performance, and energy consumption across HPC, Cloud, and Edge computing environments.

## Features

- **File Storage Management**: Distributed file system with data replication and fault tolerance.
- **I/O Optimization**: Techniques for reducing latency and increasing throughput.
- **Energy Optimization**: Algorithms for minimizing energy consumption.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Tools to benchmark and compare storage and I/O strategies.
- **User Interface**: Web-based or command-line interface for system management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/efficient-file-system-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd efficient-file-system-management
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
   Start the file system management system:
        ```bash
        python src/file_system.py
        ```

   Run the I/O optimization and energy optimization modules:
        ```bash
        python src/io_optimization.py
        python src/energy_optimization.py
        ```

   Use the benchmarking tools to measure performance:
    ```bash
        python src/benchmark.py
        ```

    - Access the web interface (if applicable) by navigating to http://localhost:5000.
